retreated to the depths from which they came.



I found him. My father, alive, weary but safe, waiting where I least expected to see him. 
The reunion was quiet at first, words unspoken, yet the relief was louder than any shout.



The forest seemed greener, the river clearer, the air lighter. Even the mushrooms, 
once tainted by the chaos, returned to their natural rhythm. The Champignon, Wood Ear, 
and Shiitake flourished once more, reminders of life’s delicate balance.




I thought of the Underground City and the Big Boss—the source of it all.

The world, though scarred, had a chance to heal.
